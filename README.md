# adblock-resources

Contains resources and scriptlets designed for use with Brave's [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust) library.

Custom resources should be added to the `resources` directory, and a corresponding entry should be added to the `metadata.json` file.

## Using

This package can be imported as a library, exposing the function `readResources` which will produce the correctly formatted list of resources for use with [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust).

Alternatively, `npm run build` will write all resources to `dist/resources.json` for future use.

To generate `metadata.json` automatically from files in `resources/`, run `npm run generateMetadata`.

Use `npm run test` after modifying the resources or metadata file to ensure the format can be accepted by `adblock-rust`.

## Metadata format

`metadata.json` is a list of elements of the following format:

```json
{
    "name": "name-of-my-resource",
    "aliases": ["an-alias-for-my-resource"],
    "kind": {"mime":"application/javascript"},
    "resourcePath": "pathRelativeToResources.js"
}
```

- `name` is the name of the resource as it would be used in a filter rule.

- `aliases` is a list containing optional additional (usually shorter) identifiers that could be used instead of the `name`. Usually this is empty or contains a single entry that is an abbreviation of the `name`.

- `kind` is either a MIME type as shown above, or simply the string `"template"` to specify that the resource is a scriptlet with optional template parameters (i.e., `{{1}}`, `{{2}}`, ...).

- `resourcePath` specifies the path to the content of the resource. It should be relative to the `resources` directory in the root of this repository.

In general, this format corresponds to the `Resource` struct from [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust), but the base64-encoded `content` field is replaced by a path to a file for better maintainability. This library will translate the `resourcePath` field back to a base64-encoded `content` field when ready for use.

## Filter list description format

The `filter_lists/*.json` files are lists of elements, each describing a filter list. The format for each element is:

```json
{
    "title": "New Filter Rules",
    "desc": "Removes new elements"
    "langs": [],
    "component_id": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
    "base64_public_key": "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAs...IDAQAB",
    "list_text_component": {
        "component_id": "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
        "base64_public_key": "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAs...IDAQAB",
    },
    "sources": [
        {
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brave/adblock-lists/master/brave-lists/new-list.txt",
            "title": "Brave New List",
            "format": "Standard",
            "support_url": "https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists",
        }
    ]
}
```

- `uuid` is a UUID generated with, for example, the CLI tool `uuidgen`.

- `title` is a human-readable title for the filter list component. Each source also has a title, which is a human-readable title for each individual list making up the full component.

- `desc` is a short human-readable description of what the filter list is designed to block.

- `langs` is a list of _locale codes_ for the given component, allowing it to be preselected in-browser by users in the corresponding regions. Note that despite the name, it should not list _language codes_.

- `component_id` and `base64_public_key` are unique constants generated per-list such that the lists can be served in CRX components created by [brave-core-crx-packager](https://github.com/brave/brave-core-crx-packager). Note that the ones inside `list_text_component` should not have the same values.

- `sources` is a list of individual filter lists that are concatenated together in order to create the full list for a component.

- `url` is the URL where a filter list source can be downloaded from. It should be a list of rules in the format specified in `format` in a plaintext file.

- `format` is either ABP/uBO-style format ("Standard", most common) or IP address and hostname ("Hosts").

- `support_url` is somewhere a user can ask for help with the filter list.

### Optional fields

The following 4 fields are all optional and default to `false` or `0` if omitted.

- `hidden` (`boolean`) should the component be displayed in brave://settings/shields/filters as an additional list option?
- `default_enabled` (`boolean`) should the component be enabled by default?
- `first_party_protections` (`boolean`) should first-party heuristics be applied to rules from the list?
- `permission_mask` (`number`) what scriptlet permissions should be granted to rules from the list?
  The bits of the bitmask are currently assigned as follows:
    - Bit `0`: "trusted" resources from the uBlock Origin project
    - Bit `1`: resources only intended for use by Brave-authored lists
    - Bits `2`-`7`: reserved

## Adding a new list

The `generate_component.sh` script can be used to help create a new filter list component.
It will generate:
- A UUID (for the top-level `uuid` field)
- A public key (corresponding to the `list_text_component.base64_public_key` field)
- A component ID (corresponding to the `list_text_component.component_id` field)
- The component's private key (in a new PEM file)

The script should be run with no arguments.
The resulting PEM file will be named `ad-block-updater-<component_id>.pem`. This new PEM file has to be uploaded to 1Password. See instructions [here](https://github.com/brave/internal/wiki/Uploading-new-adblock-list-PEM-file-to-1Password).

We will need to run this script a second time to get values for the top-level `base64_public_key` and `component_id` fields. These will be different from the values for `list_text_component.base64_public_key` and `list_text_component.component_id` fields. This is necessary for iOS, see [tracking issue](https://github.com/brave/brave-ios/issues/5974).
